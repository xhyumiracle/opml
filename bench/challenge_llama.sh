# The following variables can be overridden as environment variables:
# * BLOCK (block whose transition will be challenged)
# * WRONG_BLOCK (block number used by challenger)
# * SKIP_NODE (skip forking a node, useful if you've already forked a node)
#
# Example usage:
# SKIP_NODE=1 BLOCK=13284469 WRONG_BLOCK=13284491 ./demo/challenge_simple.sh

# --- DOC ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# In this example, the challenger will challenge the transition from a block
# (`BLOCK`), but pretends that chain state before another block (`WRONG_BLOCK`)
# is the state before the challenged block. Consequently, the challenger will
# disagree with the defender on every single step of the challenge game, and the
# single step to execute will be the very first MIPS instruction executed. The
# reason is that the initial MIPS state Merkle root is stored on-chain, and
# immediately modified to reflect the fact that the input hash for the block is
# written at address 0x3000000.
#
# (The input hash is automatically validated against the blockhash, so note that
# in this demo the challenger has to provide the correct (`BLOCK`) input hash to
# the `initiateChallenge` function of `Challenge.sol`, but will execute as
# though the input hash was the one derived from `WRONG_BLOCK`.)
#
# Because the challenger uses the wrong inputs, it will assert a post-state
# (Merkle root) for the first MIPS instruction that has the wrong input hash at
# 0x3000000. Hence, the challenge will fail.
